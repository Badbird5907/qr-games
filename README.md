This is tic-tac-toe and flappy bird implemented in typescript. **All in a SINGLE QR Code!**
I was able to fit this all inside a qr code by first bundling and minifying the code with vite, and then running it through [`qrcode-datauri`](https://github.com/Badbird5907/qrcode-datauri), a cli tool I made to gzip and embed the html file inside a datauri.

# Build
Run `pnpm run build` to build the code for yourself!
